Hi, I’m @semayuce

👀 I’m interested in information/cyber/physical security, risk, governance, compliance, audit, data protection and a lot more :)
🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github - I was once a developer (20+ years ago), missed all these coffee and coding days/nights as I am now (in fact since 15+ years) more on the strategy, policy, presentation side :)
💞️ I want to use this space to share all my bookmarked sources related to my interested areas - which hopefully be useful for you and would be more than happy if you could add yours, too.

📫 You can reach me via @semayuce on twitter or https://www.linkedin.com/in/semayuce/
